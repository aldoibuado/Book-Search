  ## Description 
  In this day in age, technology has progressed so much. Before the internet and early computers, a person would have to go to the library to search for books that they liked or enjoyed. With refactoring a book search engine, it gave me the opportunity to challenge myself and figure out how to make the applicaiton function properly. Having the ability to search, save and delete your favortie books from your account is helfpul. I learned how to set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL, modify existing authentication middleware and create and Apollo Provider.
